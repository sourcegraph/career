# Software Engineer

### About the Company

From sustainable energy systems to self-driving cars, the innovations of the future will all rely on code. With so much software to write, developers need a better way to access, understand, and collaborate on code.

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. One that will enable developers (and the companies that rely on them) to more quickly turn great ideas into groundbreaking technology. Effectively, we want to bring the future sooner.

### About the Team

Our small team consists of talented, mature, collaborative, driven individuals who are attracted to the massive problem we are tackling. We work in an open environment that treats people in a first-class manner and provides them with ownership, responsibility, and autonomy.
Our founders featured on [Forbes “30 under 30” 2017](https://text.sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph-founders-featured-on-forbes-30-under-30-list-8ff9c9b6eb45#.weps4istp).

### About the Role

You will help build Sourcegraph, a multi-tier application (web, CLI, API, data stores, services) written primarily in TypeScript (frontend) and Go (backend). You will have the freedom to creatively tackle various CS challenges while building products that are fundamental to the growth and success of the business. As a senior member of the team, you will help set the technical direction of various projects as well as mentor other team members. This is a full-stack role and ideal candidates should feel comfortable (though not equally skilled) at all layers of the stack.

### Example projects:

* Reduce P95 latency of "code intelligence" requests (e.g. hover tooltips, find references, go-to-definition)
* Scale our language analysis cluster to meet traffic demands; mitigate infrastructure costs
* Design and implement a system to perform fast, real-time, cross-repository `git grep`

### Responsibilities

* Design and build multi-tier web & desktop applications using Go & TypeScript
* Combine system metrics, user feedback, and intuition to plan improvements
* Create simple and performant APIs and services based on multiple underlying data sources
* Lead and mentor other team members while driving technical roadmaps and decisions for various projects

### Ideal Candidates Have

* Track record of delivering high-quality products with attention to scalability and UX
* Strong web/JavaScript/TypeScript/Go fundamentals
* Passion for the craft of software development and good engineering practices

### Interview process

Our interview process can adapt to your preferences, so don't hesitate to tell us what works best for you.

A typical interview process looks like this:

1.  You apply.
2.  We schedule a 30 minute phone call to share what we are looking for in a candidate and to find out what you are looking for in your next role.
3.  We schedule a 1 hour technical phone screen to see how you code. If you have any public code that you can share with us (e.g. open source), we would love to look at that too!
4.  Depending on the circumstances, we will propose one of the following:
    * We bring you onsite to our San Francisco office for 4-5 hours of interviews and to meet more of the team.
    * We pay you to work on a real project and evaluate your performance based on that.
5.  We make you a job offer.

We also expect you to be interviewing us too, so ask us any questions you have along the way!
