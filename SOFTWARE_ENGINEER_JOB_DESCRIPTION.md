# Software Engineer (onsite or remote)

You will help build Sourcegraph, a multi-tier application (web, CLI, API, data stores, services) written primarily in TypeScript (frontend) and Go (backend). You will have the freedom to creatively tackle various CS challenges while building products that are fundamental to the growth and success of the business.

You will have the opportunity to interact directly with our customers to help them deploy/configure our software, and solve issues that they encounter.

As a senior member of the team, you will help set the technical direction of various projects as well as mentor other team members. This is a full-stack role and ideal candidates should feel comfortable (though not equally skilled) at all layers of the stack.

- Scale our language analysis cluster to meet traffic demands; mitigate infrastructure costs
- Design and implement a system to perform fast, real-time, cross-repository `git grep`

### Responsibilities

- Design and build multi-tier web & desktop applications using Go & TypeScript
- Combine system metrics, user feedback, and intuition to plan improvements
- Create simple and performant APIs and services based on multiple underlying data sources
- Lead and mentor other team members while driving technical roadmaps and decisions for various projects

### Ideal Candidates Have

- Track record of delivering high-quality products with attention to scalability and UX
- Strong web/JavaScript/TypeScript/Go fundamentals
- Passion for the craft of software development and good engineering practices

### Interview process

1.  You [apply here](https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/sourcegraphcom/view/P_AAAAAADAAADP_pY7jAAAXU).
2.  We schedule a 30 minute phone call to share what we are looking for in a candidate and to find out what you are looking for in your next role.
3.  [Optional] If you have any code samples that you can share with us, we would love to look at that.
    - Open source projects that you created.

    - We pay you to work on a small project.
    - We schedule a series of remote technical interviews.
      - We will write some code in a tool like https://coderpad.io.
    - We bring you to our San Francisco office for 4-5 hours of interviews and to meet more of the team.
      - We will write some code in your preferred editor or in a tool like https://coderpad.io.
