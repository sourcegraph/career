# Software Engineer (onsite or remote)

You will help build Sourcegraph, a multi-tier application (web, CLI, API, data stores, services) written primarily in TypeScript (frontend) and Go (backend). You will have the freedom to creatively tackle various CS challenges while building products that are fundamental to the growth and success of the business.

You will have the opportunity to interact directly with our customers to help them deploy/configure our software, and solve issues that they encounter.

As a senior member of the team, you will help set the technical direction of various projects as well as mentor other team members. This is a full-stack role and ideal candidates should feel comfortable (though not equally skilled) at all layers of the stack.

### Example projects:

- Reduce P95 latency of "code intelligence" requests (e.g. hover tooltips, find references, go-to-definition)
- Scale our language analysis cluster to meet traffic demands; mitigate infrastructure costs
- Design and implement a system to perform fast, real-time, cross-repository `git grep`

### Responsibilities

- Design and build multi-tier web & desktop applications using Go & TypeScript
- Combine system metrics, user feedback, and intuition to plan improvements
- Create simple and performant APIs and services based on multiple underlying data sources
- Lead and mentor other team members while driving technical roadmaps and decisions for various projects

### Ideal Candidates Have

- Track record of delivering high-quality products with attention to scalability and UX
- Strong web/JavaScript/TypeScript/Go fundamentals
- Passion for the craft of software development and good engineering practices

### Interview process

1.  You [apply here](https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/sourcegraphcom/view/P_AAAAAADAAADP_pY7jAAAXU).
2.  We schedule a 30 minute phone call to share what we are looking for in a candidate and to find out what you are looking for in your next role.
3.  We collect a sample of how you code. This could come from one or more sources:

    - Open source projects that you created, maintain, or contribute to (e.g. a non-trivial pull request).
    - A phone screen where we write some code in a tool like https://coderpad.io.
      - We avoid trick questions and problems that require a single epiphany to solve.
    - A small project we pay you to work on.

4.  We conduct ~3 more interviews which can be on site or remote depending on the circumstances.

    - We don't ask whiteboard coding questions.

5.  We check your references.
6.  We make you a job offer.

We also expect you to be interviewing us too, so ask us any questions you have along the way!
