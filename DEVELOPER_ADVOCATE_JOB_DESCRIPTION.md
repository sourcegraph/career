# Developer Advocate

We are searching for an individual who wants to help every developer in the world get access to the best tools. The ideal candidate will be a developer, someone who understands the pains of searching for a piece of code on GitHub (or similar), the frustration of working in a code editor that doesn’t provide code intelligence (e.g., go to definition, hover tooltips, find references), or the time burned in re-configuring developer tools for a new open source project.

We have built a product that our tens of thousands of users love, and you will help us bring it to tens of millions more.
