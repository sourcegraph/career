# Go code exercise

We designed this exercise to measure your understanding of HTTP requests, concurrency, and error handling.

- You will choose a two hour timeframe to independently work on the exercise. You can choose any day and time; we just schedule an email.
- At your chosen date and time, we will send you detailed instructions. You will be building a simple API server in Go that calls a JSON endpoint of another service and exposes a JSON endpoint of its own.
- You should have a recent version of Go installed on your computer.
- You can look up documentation on the internet while you are coding.
- You are not prohibited from using open-source libries, but the problem is easily solved using only the Go standard library.
- After two hours, you will email us your solution as a zip file and we will get back to you on next steps within 2 business days.

If we have questions about your code, we might schedule a 30-minute followup call.
