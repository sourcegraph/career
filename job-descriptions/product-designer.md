### About the Company

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. The innovations of the future will all rely on code. By empowering software developers today, we can literally bring the future sooner.

We have already built the world's best [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/search/) that is used and loved by large and small engineering organizations across the world.
[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/server) and our [browser extensions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/browser) provide IDE-like code intelligence (e.g. hover tooltips, go to definition, find references, and much more) in your code host, in code review, and everywhere you read code.
