# UX Designer (San Francisco or remote)

### About us

Sourcegraph's mission is to enable every software developer to create products using the best technology. The innovations of the future will all rely on software, and we want to bring the future sooner by building the best tools that help developers answer questions about their code. You can learn more about our mission by reading [our master plan](https://sourcegraph.com/plan).

Our values:

- **Inclusivity**. To build a product that serves the needs of all developers, we need to have a diverse team. Sourcegraph is an equal opportunity workplace; we embrace diversity and welcome people from all backgrounds and communities.
- **Openness**. We are an [open company](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/open_source_open_company): our code, our product roadmap, and our company processes are public. This transparency helps us rapidly gather feedback from our customers so we can iterate, learn, and deliver the best product.
- **Progress**. We make continuous progress on our product by [releasing a new version of Sourcegraph every month](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/releases). Check out [our product roadmap](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/roadmap) to see what we are working on next. We also hold [regular retrospectives](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/retrospectives) to learn how we can work better as a team.

### About the role

We are looking for a self-motivated UX designer with the leadership skills to be the facilitator of design, and the pragmatism to be the person responsible for producing and executing the design.

- Use prototyping and usability testing to inform and validate designs.
- Collaborate directly with customers to inform strategy and design decisions.

We will encourage and support you to:

- Publish blog posts and give conference talks about your work at Sourcegraph.

#### Your qualifications

You have:

- Expertise in designing complex web applications as demonstrated in a strong portfolio showcasing high-quality UX, interaction, and visual design.
- Proficiency with Figma, Sketch, or similar tools to design end-to-end experiences (UX, interaction, and visual).
- Experience with usability testing, customer journey mapping, developing personas, wireframing and prototyping, sketching, and other UX design methods.
- The ability to adapt your tools and processes for the velocity of a fast-paced startup where projects have varying requirement levels.
- The ability to proactively give maintenance to the design system when thinking about how new concepts impact the whole product.
- A knack for giving and receiving feedback, and explaining the reasoning behind your designs.
- A deep understanding of developers, and a good understanding of version control systems, preferably Git.

#### Nice to haves

You have:

- Experience designing developer tools.
- Experience working in cross-functional teams on multiple projects in tandem.
- Experience building or contributing to the design of consumer or enterprise applications.
- Experience working with distributed or remote teams.
