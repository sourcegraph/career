# TypeScript code exercise

We designed this exercise to measure your understanding of how callbacks and asyncronous execution works.

- You will choose a two hour timeframe to independently work on the exercise. You can choose any day and time; we just schedule an email.
- At your chosen date and time, we will send you a zipped TypeScript project that contains instructions and some unit tests.
- You should have Node.js (>=8.16.0) installed on your computer.
- You can look up documentation on the internet while you are coding.
- You may use open-source libraries, but most candidates don't find it necessary.
- After two hours, you will email us your solution as a zip file and we will get back to you on next steps within 2 business days.

If we have questions about your code, we might schedule a 30-minute followup call.
