### About the role

_This is a paid internship_

As an intern, you will help build Sourcegraph, a multi-tier application (web, CLI, browser extensions, API, data stores, services) written primarily in TypeScript (frontend) and Go (backend). You will be matched with a mentor who will help plan your work, and then you will have responsibility and autonomy to get the work done.

Example intern projects from past years:

- Build a browser extension from scratch that communicates with the Sourcegraph API to inject code intelligence on http://github.com.
- Build a Sourcegraph electron application that is synced with the cursor position in your editor via an editor extension.
- Integrate Sourcegraph search into Alfred.

### Ideal candidates:

- Are pursuing a computer science undergraduate or graduate degree.
- Can demonstrate passion and excitement about developer tools (e.g. have built a developer tool, contributed to open source developer tools or other open source projects, written blog posts or talks about development, etc.)
