# Software Engineer Internship (San Francisco)

### About us

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. The innovations of the future will all rely on code. By empowering software developers today, we can bring the future sooner.

We have already built the world's best [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/search/) that is used and loved by large and small engineering organizations across the world.
[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/server) and our [browser extensions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/browser) provide IDE-like code intelligence (e.g. hover tooltips, go to definition, find references, and much more) in your code host, in code review, and everywhere you read code.

Read [our blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/) to see what more we have been working on recently and read [our master plan](https://sourcegraph.com/plan) to see where we are going!

### About the role

_This is a paid internship_

As an intern, you will help build Sourcegraph, a multi-tier application (web, CLI, browser extensions, API, data stores, services) written primarily in TypeScript (frontend) and Go (backend). You will be matched with a mentor who will help plan your work, and then you will have responsibility and autonomy to get the work done.

Example intern projects from past years:

- Build a browser extension from scratch that communicates with the Sourcegraph API to inject code intelligence on http://github.com.
- Build a Sourcegraph electron application that is synced with the cursor position in your editor via an editor extension.
- Integrate Sourcegraph search into Alfred.

### Ideal candidates:

- Are pursuing a computer science undergraduate or graduate degree.
- Can demonstrate passion and excitement about developer tools (e.g. have built a developer tool, contributed to open source developer tools or other open source projects, written blog posts or talks about development, etc.)
