# Software Engineer Internship (San Francisco)

### About us

Sourcegraph's mission is to enable every software developer to create products using the best technology. The innovations of the future will all rely on software, and we want to bring the future sooner by building the best tools that help developers answer questions about their code. You can learn more about our mission by reading [our master plan](https://sourcegraph.com/plan).

Our values:

- **Inclusivity**. To build a product that serves the needs of all developers, we are building a diverse team that is distributed across the world. Sourcegraph is an equal opportunity workplace; we welcome people from all backgrounds and communities.
- **Openness**. We are an [open company](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/open_source_open_company): our code, our product roadmap, and our company processes are public. This transparency helps us rapidly gather feedback from our customers so we can iterate, learn, and deliver the best product.
- **Progress**. We make continuous progress on our product by [releasing a new version of Sourcegraph every month](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/releases). Check out [our product roadmap](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/roadmap) to see what we are working on next. We also hold [regular retrospectives](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/retrospectives) to learn how we can work better as a team.

If you are passionate about making the world better through software, come join us!

### About the role

_This is a paid internship_

You will help build Sourcegraph, a code search and navigation product, by collaborating on a small team to solve challenging problems that are fundamental to the growth and success of our business.

Example intern projects from past years:

- Build a browser extension from scratch that communicates with the Sourcegraph API to inject code intelligence on http://github.com.
- Build a Sourcegraph electron application that is synced with the cursor position in your editor via an editor extension.
- Integrate Sourcegraph search into Alfred.
- Add symbol data to our search index.

You will be matched with a mentor who will help plan your work, and then you will have responsibility and autonomy to get the work done.

### Ideal candidates:

- Are pursuing a computer science undergraduate or graduate degree.
- Have experience with the basics of either Go or TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Can demonstrate passion and excitement about developer tools (e.g. have built a developer tool, contributed to open source developer tools or other open source projects, written blog posts or talks about development, etc.)
