# Software Engineer Internship (San Francisco)

### About the company

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. The innovations of the future will all rely on code. By empowering software developers today, we can literally bring the future sooner.

We have already built the world's best [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/search/) that is used and loved by large and small engineering organizations across the world.
[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/server) and our [browser extensions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/browser) provide IDE-like code intelligence (e.g. hover tooltips, go to definition, find references, and much more) in your code host, in code review, and everywhere you read code.

Read [our blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/) to see what more we have been working on recently and read [our master plan](https://sourcegraph.com/plan) to see where we are going!

### About the team

Our small team consists of talented, mature, collaborative, driven individuals who are attracted to the massive problem we are tackling. We work in an open environment that treats people in a first-class manner and provides them with ownership, responsibility, and autonomy.

### About the role

As an intern, you will help build Sourcegraph, a multi-tier application (web, CLI, browser extensions, API, data stores, services) written primarily in TypeScript (frontend) and Go (backend). You will be matched with a mentor who will help plan your work, and then you will have responsibility and autonomy to get the work done.

Requirements:
- You are passionate about building tools for developers.

Ideal candidates:

- Are pursuing a computer science undergraduate or graduate degree.
- Are familiar with one or more of the technologies that we use (e.g. Go, TypeScript, React).
- Have built or contributed to a developer tool or library (e.g. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph).

Example intern projects from past years:

- Build a browser extension from scratch that communicates with the Sourcegraph API to inject code intelligence on http://github.com.
- Build a Sourcegraph electron application that is synced with the cursor position in your editor via an editor extension.
- Integrate Sourcegraph search into Alfred.
