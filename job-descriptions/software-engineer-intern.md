# Software Engineer Internship (San Francisco)

### About us

We're building the new standard developer platform. Top tech companies have invested \$100Ms to build internal developer platforms for code search, code review, alerts, and automation. Sourcegraph provides this standard developer platform to every company, helping startups and large enterprises ship better software faster.

[Our mission](https://sourcegraph.com/plan) is to dramatically increase the number of people who can understand and write code. By making code more accessible, we will democratize software development and accelerate innovations that bring the future sooner in transportation, health care, energy, AI, communication, space travel, etc.

We value openness and transparency. [Our code](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph), [our product roadmap](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/team/roadmap), and [our company processes](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/team/product-dev/open_source_open_company) are public. This transparency helps us rapidly gather feedback from our customers so we can iterate, learn, and deliver the best product.

To create a product that serves the needs of all developers, we are building a diverse remote-first team that is distributed across the world. Sourcegraph is an equal opportunity workplace; we welcome people from all backgrounds and communities.

If you are passionate about making the world better through software, come join us!

### About the role

_This is a paid internship_

You will help build Sourcegraph, a code search and navigation product, by collaborating on a small team to solve challenging problems that are fundamental to the growth and success of our business.

Example intern projects from past years:

- Build a browser extension from scratch that communicates with the Sourcegraph API to inject code intelligence on http://github.com.
- Build a Sourcegraph electron application that is synced with the cursor position in your editor via an editor extension.
- Integrate Sourcegraph search into Alfred.
- Add symbol data to our search index.

You will be matched with a mentor who will help plan your work, and then you will have responsibility and autonomy to get the work done.

### Ideal candidates:

- Are pursuing a computer science undergraduate or graduate degree.
- Have experience with the basics of either Go or TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Can demonstrate passion and excitement about developer tools (e.g. have built a developer tool, contributed to open source developer tools or other open source projects, written blog posts or talks about development, etc.)
