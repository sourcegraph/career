We are looking for an engineer and operator to build and improve our internal tools. As we grow our team and customer base rapidly, we need your help building, upgrading, and maintaining the internal systems that are straining to keep up!

- Evaluating and implementing single sign-on software to make onboarding smoother.
- Building and deploying internal tools/bots for our engineering and analytics teams.
- Coordinating implementation work with outside contractors for complex systems (e.g. Salesforce).
- Connecting and automating parts of our user journey (e.g. connecting our product to our billing systems; connecting user satisfaction surveys to our marketing tools; automating our quote-to-cash for our sales team).

## Qualifications

- Excitement for software development and [our mission to make it so that everyone can code](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/strategy).
- Experience working in implementation, engineering, IT, training, or other roles with internal "customers."
- Some software development experience, with an interest in learning and doing more.
