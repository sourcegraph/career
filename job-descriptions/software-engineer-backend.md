# Software Engineer - Backend

We are looking for backend engineers who know how to design and build performance-sensitive distributed systems. You will innovate key systems (e.g., code search, campaigns, syntax highlighting, auth, code host integrations) to make [Universal Code Search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product) more powerful and scale to our customers with the largest codebases in the world. Read [our product roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#heading=h.fv5i7qi85bru) to see the challenges that we are working on today and in the near future.

## Qualifications

- Solid understanding of Go fundamentals (e.g., dealing with concurrency, error handling, unit testing).
- Skilled at designing, building, testing (e.g., unit, integration, end-to-end), and debugging high performance distributed systems.
- Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.
- Practiced at creating high quality software balanced with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.
- Good knowledge of Git in particular and other version control systems more generally.

## Nice-to-haves

- Experience making distributed systems observable (e.g., logging, Prometheus metrics, request tracing).
- Experience using Postgres and Redis.
- Experience load testing distributed systems.
- Experience writing high performance Go code and benchmarks.
- Large and/or numerous contributions to open source projects.
- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
