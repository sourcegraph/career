# Software Engineer - Security

We are looking for an expert to own security at Sourcegraph. This includes the security of Sourcegraph.com as well as making it easy for our customers to secure their own private Sourcegraph instances that they deploy on-premise. You will have the opportunity to build a world-class security culture and team from the ground up.

## Responsibilities

In the first 30 days, you will:

- Identify what our security needs are and develop a roadmap to improve and ensure the security of our product.
- Promptly respond to and address security issues reported to us by third parties.

In the first 60 days, you will:

- Execute on that roadmap through a mix of directly contributing to our codebase (i.e., Go, TypeScript, Kubernetes, Docker, Google Cloud Platform) yourself, and helping other engineers on our team make the necessary changes. You should expect that at least 75% of your effort will be direct contributions to start.
- Create a hiring plan and interview process to build the team that is necessary to secure Sourcegraph.

In the first year, you will:

- Be the engineering manager for the security team that you have built.
- Create a culture of security at Sourcegraph that empowers all of our engineers to write secure code.

## Qualifications

- Broad knowledge of possible attack vectors for on-premise and cloud applications like Sourcegraph and an understanding of how to eliminate and/or mitigate those security risks. This knowledge generally comes from having many years of experience in the domain of security.
- Experience leading security teams (as a people manager or as a technical leader).
- Ability to understand, debug, and write Go and TypeScript to fix security issues.
- Ability to secure cloud applications that use our tech stack: Kuberentes, Docker, Google Cloud Platform.
- Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.

## Nice-to-haves

- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
- Experience working on high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.
