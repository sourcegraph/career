# Software Engineer - Security

We are looking for a software engineer to own the security of our product. This includes the security of sourcegraph.com as well as making it easy for our customers to secure their own private Sourcegraph instances that they deploy on-premise. You will be responsible for proactively understanding, documenting, and improving the security of our product, as well as promptly responding to and addressing security issues reported to us by third parties. As our security needs grow over time, there is a potential for you to grow into a security team leadership role.

## Qualifications

We are looking for candidates with the following skills, and we will test for these things in our interview process:

- Broad knowledge of possible attack vectors for applications like Sourcegraph and an understanding of how to eliminate and/or mitigate those security risks. This knowledge generally comes from having multiple years of software development experience in the security domain.
- Skilled at understanding, debugging, and writing code (ideally Go and TypeScript) to identify and fix security issues.
- Demonstrated ability to own large ambiguous problems while making continuous progress.
- Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.

## Nice-to-haves
