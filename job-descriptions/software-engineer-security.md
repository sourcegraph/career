- Broad knowledge of attack vectors and threat actors for the life cycle of on-premise and cloud applications, including triage, remediation, and continuous improvement.
- Ability to understand, debug, and write Go and TypeScript to fix security issues.
- Ability to secure cloud applications that use our tech stack: Kubernetes, Docker, Google Cloud Platform.
- Ability to define, plan, and prioritize security work that needs to be done (and then go do that work).

## Nice-to-haves

- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
- Experience working on high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.
- Experience improving the security posture of a small team, and helping that team carry the baton themselves.
