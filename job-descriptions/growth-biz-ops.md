# Growth & Business Operations

### About the company

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. The innovations of the future will all rely on code. By empowering software developers today, we can literally bring the future sooner.

We have already built the world's best [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/search/) that is used and loved by large and small engineering organizations across the world.
[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/server) and our [browser extensions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/browser) provide IDE-like code intelligence (e.g. hover tooltips, go to definition, find references, and much more) in your code host, in code review, and everywhere you read code.

### About the team

Our small team consists of talented, mature, collaborative, driven individuals who are attracted to the massive problem we are tackling. We work in an open environment that treats people in a first-class manner and provides them with ownership, responsibility, and autonomy.

### About the role

Every company in the world is a software company, and every developer in the world needs Sourcegraph. We are building a product that empowers developers, and are looking for someone who wants to help us bring the best development tools to every team in the world.

We have demonstrated strong product-market fit, through signals such as customer engagement and usage metrics, satisfaction scores, and most importantly, sales to large enterprise customers. We have grown largely through word of mouth in the past, and are now looking to accelerate, while staying true to our authentic, bottom-up go-to-market model (we strive to learn from companies like Atlassian, Stripe, Hashicorp, Dropbox, GitLab, and more). The individual who fills this role will help us build a Growth and Analytics team from the ground up.

The ideal candidate will be excited by software development and the dev tools industry (no training as an Engineer required), have a strong analytical background, and bring creativity and a “fail fast” mentality to our Growth and Marketing efforts. We have built a product that our tens of thousands of users love; you will help us bring it to tens of millions more.

### Responsibilities

- Help define, dissect, and optimize Sourcegraph’s user acquisition funnel and customer journey.
- Think creatively about ways to grow or optimize different stages in the user journey/funnel.
- Execute (this is not just a role for high-level consulting).
- Be data-driven to quickly prioritize opportunities.
- Work effectively cross-functionally (for example, work with Design, Engineering, and Product teams to run A/B tests).
- Help our go-to-market teams (Developer Advocates and Sales) prioritize opportunities to invest their time.
- Get to know and learn from Sourcegraph’s users, customers, and partners.

### Ideal candidates have

- Demonstrated background in analytical roles (BizOps, Consulting, Growth, Finance, etc.).
- Creativity, and a willingness to try everything and iterate quickly (e.g. ideas that won’t scale or ideas that sound crazy at first).
- Excitement and enthusiasm about building up a new function inside Sourcegraph.
- Familiarity with SQL (or other languages/tools) for data analysis.
