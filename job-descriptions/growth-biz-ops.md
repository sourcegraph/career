# Growth & Business Operations

### About us

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. The innovations of the future will all rely on code. By empowering software developers today, we can bring the future sooner.

We have already built the world's best [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/search/) that is used and loved by large and small engineering organizations across the world.
[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/server) and our [browser extensions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/browser) provide IDE-like code intelligence (e.g. hover tooltips, go to definition, find references, and much more) in your code host, in code review, and everywhere you read code.

### Benefits

In addition to competitive pay and equity, [we provide many benefits](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers#benefits) to keep you happy, healthy, and productive.

### About the role

Every company in the world is a software company, and every developer in the world needs Sourcegraph. We are building a product that empowers developers, and are looking for someone who wants to help us bring the best development tools to every team in the world.

We have demonstrated strong product-market fit, but have grown largely through word of mouth in the past. We are looking to accelerate, while staying true to our authentic, bottom-up go-to-market model (we strive to learn from companies like Atlassian, Stripe, Hashicorp, Dropbox, GitLab, and more).

You will:

- Help define, dissect, and optimize Sourcegraph’s user acquisition funnel and customer journey.
- Think creatively about ways to grow or optimize different stages in the user journey/funnel.
- Execute (this is not just a role for high-level consulting).
- Be data-driven in helping our go-to-market teams (Developer Advocates and Sales) prioritize opportunities to invest their time.
- Help build a growth and business team from the ground up.

### Ideal candidates have

- A passion and excitement for software development (no training as an Engineer required) and growth.
- Demonstrated background in analytical roles (BizOps, Consulting, Growth, Finance, etc.).
- Familiarity with SaaS business models, and how software companies grow.
- Creativity, and a willingness to try everything and iterate quickly (e.g. ideas that won’t scale or ideas that sound "crazy" at first).
