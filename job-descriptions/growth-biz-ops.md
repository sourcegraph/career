# Growth & Business Operations (San Francisco)

### About us

Sourcegraph's mission is to enable every software developer to create products using the best technology. The innovations of the future will all rely on software, and we want to bring the future sooner by building the best tools that help developers answer questions about their code. You can learn more about our mission by reading [our master plan](https://sourcegraph.com/plan).

Our values:

- **Inclusivity**. To build a product that serves the needs of all developers, we need to have a diverse team. Sourcegraph is an equal opportunity workplace; we embrace diversity and welcome people from all backgrounds and communities.
- **Openess**. We are an [open company](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/open_source_open_company): our code, our product roadmap, and our company processes are public. This transparency helps us rapidly gather feedback from our customers so we can iterate, learn, and deliver the best product.
- **Progress**. We make continuous progress on our product by [releasing a new version of Sourcegraph every month](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/releases). Check out [our product roadmap](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/roadmap) to see what we are working on next. We also hold [regular retrospectives](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/retrospectives) to learn how we can work better as a team.

If you are passionate about making the world better through software, come join us!

### About the role

Every company in the world is a software company, and every developer in the world needs Sourcegraph. We are building a product that empowers developers, and are looking for someone who wants to help us bring the best development tools to every team in the world.

We have demonstrated strong product-market fit, but have grown largely through word of mouth in the past. We are looking to accelerate, while staying true to our authentic, bottom-up go-to-market model (we strive to learn from companies like Atlassian, Stripe, Hashicorp, Dropbox, GitLab, and more).

You will:

- Help define, dissect, and optimize Sourcegraph’s user acquisition funnel and customer journey.
- Think creatively about ways to grow or optimize different stages in the user journey/funnel.
- Execute (this is not just a role for high-level consulting).
- Be data-driven in helping our go-to-market teams (Developer Advocates and Sales) prioritize opportunities to invest their time.
- Help build a growth and business team from the ground up.

### Ideal candidates have

- A passion and excitement for software development (no training as an Engineer required, but you should have an understanding of how software development happens and Sourcegraph's value proposition).
- Demonstrated background in analytical roles (BizOps, Growth, Consulting, Finance, etc.).
- Familiarity with SaaS business models, and how software companies grow.
- Creativity, and a willingness to try everything and iterate quickly (e.g. ideas that won’t scale or ideas that sound "crazy" at first).

### Compensation and benefits

We provide competitive pay and equity because we want you to act like a business owner and share in the success of Sourcegraph. We also provide [many benefits](../README.md#benefits) to keep you happy, healthy, and productive.
