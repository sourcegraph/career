### Benefits

In addition to competitive pay and equity, [we provide many benefits](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers#benefits) to keep you happy, healthy, and productive.

### About the role

Every company in the world is a software company, and every developer in the world needs Sourcegraph. We are building a product that empowers developers, and are looking for someone who wants to help us bring the best development tools to every team in the world.

We have demonstrated strong product-market fit, but have grown largely through word of mouth in the past. We are looking to accelerate, while staying true to our authentic, bottom-up go-to-market model (we strive to learn from companies like Atlassian, Stripe, Hashicorp, Dropbox, GitLab, and more).

You will:

- Help define, dissect, and optimize Sourcegraph’s user acquisition funnel and customer journey.
- Think creatively about ways to grow or optimize different stages in the user journey/funnel.
- Execute (this is not just a role for high-level consulting).
- Be data-driven in helping our go-to-market teams (Developer Advocates and Sales) prioritize opportunities to invest their time.
- Help build a growth and business team from the ground up.

### Ideal candidates have

- A passion and excitement for software development (no training as an Engineer required, but you should have an understanding of how software development happens and Sourcegraph's value proposition).
- Demonstrated background in analytical roles (BizOps, Growth, Consulting, Finance, etc.).
- Familiarity with SaaS business models, and how software companies grow.
- Creativity, and a willingness to try everything and iterate quickly (e.g. ideas that won’t scale or ideas that sound "crazy" at first).
