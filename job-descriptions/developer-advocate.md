# Developer Advocate

### About the Company

From sustainable energy systems to self-driving cars, the innovations of the future will all rely on code. With so much software to write, developers need a better way to access, understand, and collaborate on code.

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. One that will enable developers (and the companies that rely on them) to more quickly turn great ideas into groundbreaking technology. Effectively, we want to bring the future sooner.
Check out what we are building for developers and why it matters: https://sourcegraph.com/plan.

### About the Team

Our small team consists of talented, mature, collaborative, driven individuals who are attracted to the massive problem we are tackling. We work in an open environment that treats people in a first-class manner and provides them with ownership, responsibility, and autonomy.

### About the Role

We are searching for an individual who wants to help every developer in the world get access to the best tools. The ideal candidate will be a developer, someone who understands the pains of searching for a piece of code on GitHub (or similar), the frustration of working in a code editor that doesn’t provide code intelligence (e.g., go to definition, hover tooltips, find references), or the time burned in re-configuring developer tools for a new open source project.

We have built a product that our tens of thousands of users love, and you will help us bring it to tens of millions more.

### Responsibilities

- Effectively communicate the value of Sourcegraph to developers who haven’t used it before.
- Constantly be learning and experimenting with new developer tools and processes.
- Provide a voice of the user to guide internal strategy and decision-making about Sourcegraph’s products.
- Help the team write documentation that’s usable and clear for our target audience.
- Write interesting content that developers would want to read.
- Attend meetups, conferences, and other developer events.

### Ideal Candidates Have

- Experience as a programmer, in order to understand the product and user need.
- A voracious appetite for learning about developer processes, and following new product offerings around the industry.
- Strong public speaking skills.
- A demonstrated ability to write about technical topics in an interesting, concise, and useful way.
- A desire to meet new people and attend new events.
- A willingness to learn on the job, and to try multiple, creative approaches to reach users.
- A knack for giving and receiving feedback.
