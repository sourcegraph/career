# Developer Advocate

### About us

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. The innovations of the future will all rely on code. By empowering software developers today, we can bring the future sooner.

We have already built the world's best [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/search/) that is used and loved by large and small engineering organizations across the world.
[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/server) and our [browser extensions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/browser) provide IDE-like code intelligence (e.g. hover tooltips, go to definition, find references, and much more) in your code host, in code review, and everywhere you read code.

### Benefits

In addition to competitive pay and equity, [we provide many benefits](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers#benefits) to keep you happy, healthy, and productive.

### About the role

We are searching for a teammate who wants to help every developer in the world get access to the best tools. The ideal candidate will be a developer, someone who understands the pains of searching for a piece of code on GitHub (or similar), the frustration of working in a code editor that doesn’t provide code intelligence (such as "go to definition"), or the time burned in re-configuring developer tools for a new project.

You will:

- Effectively communicate the value of Sourcegraph to developers who haven’t used it before (in person at events or through content).
- Constantly be learning and experimenting with new developer tools and processes.
- Provide a voice of the user to guide internal strategy and decision-making.
- Help the team write documentation that’s usable and clear for our target audience.

### Ideal candidates have

- Experience as a programmer (limited, or as a hobby, is fine), in order to understand the product and user need.
- A voracious appetite for learning about developer processes, and following new product offerings around the industry.
- A demonstrated ability in either (or both) public speaking and presenting, or writing about technical topics in an interesting, concise, and useful way.
- A willingness to learn on the job, and to try multiple, creative approaches to reach users.

### Interview process

1.  You [apply here](https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/sourcegraphcom/view/P_AAAAAADAAC5MQNTwVOcGlT).
2.  We schedule a 30 minute phone call to share what we are looking for in a candidate and to find out what you are looking for in your next role.
3.  We collect a sample or samples of how you present and write. This could come from one or more sources:

    - A presentation to the Sourcegraph team on a technical topic.
    - A small content creation project we pay you to work on.
    - Blog posts from past jobs or personal experience.

4.  We schedule a few more hours interviews. We are happy to fly you out to our San Francisco office to meet the team in person, or to conduct the remaining interviews remotely, whatever works best for you.
5.  We check your references.
6.  We make you a job offer.

We also expect you to be interviewing us too, so ask us any questions you have along the way!
