### About us

Sourcegraph's mission is to enable every software developer to create products using the best technology. The innovations of the future will all rely on software, and we want to bring the future sooner by building the best tools that help developers answer questions about their code. You can learn more about our mission by reading [our master plan](https://sourcegraph.com/plan).

### About the role

You will help Sourcegraph win the hearts and minds of every software developer in the world. Every company is a software company, and every developer needs Sourcegraph. 

Elite developers at companies such as Google and Facebook have changed the way software is developed. With large quantities of code available from within their team, the rest of their company, and open source, developing software starts with searching for existing components, and not assuming you must build everything from scratch. We have built a code search product that empowers both individual developers and development teams and are looking for someone who can help us reach more users. We have strong product-market fit, with thousands of daily active users inside of some of the world’s most elite software firms, grown almost entirely through word of mouth. 

We are looking to accelerate awareness and turn visitors into users and users into champions. You will help us execute, while also building a strategy for growing Sourcegraph’s marketing efforts. 

#### Your responsibilities

You will:

- Optimize [our homepage](https://about.sourcegraph.com) through measurement and testing.
- Create custom landing pages targeted at user segments and use cases, advertise for them, and quantitatively measure their success.
- Run and test ad campaigns across multiple platforms.
- Work with our Developer Relations team to optimize traffic and installations from [our blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/).
- Design marketing content and copy, and work with our Design and Product team to launch new products, run events, and more.
- Work with our Sales team to understand our customers and to test marketing messaging to maximize qualified leads.

#### Ideal candidates have

- Experience managing multi-faceted online marketing efforts (i.e., including more than just ad purchasing, or just homepage design, etc.) at another early- or mid-stage company.
- Comfort with Hubspot or Marketo or equivalents. (We use Hubspot)
- A passion for and excitement about software development (no training as an engineer required).
- Fearlessness in learning new marketing technologies and tools.
- Demonstrated analytical skillset, and an understanding of how to quantitatively measure return on investment.
- Enthusiasm for building a new team and new strategy from scratch, and working on challenging open-ended problems.
- A feeling for design, either creating art yourself or working closely with designers. Ideally both.

### Location
